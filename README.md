# tandem-straight
This repository contains a tutorial for how to generate continua using the TANDEM-STRAIGHT GUI. 

TANDEM-STRAIGHT is a program that can be used to create a continuum (of n steps) between two endpoint audio files. Applications for continua generation include stimuli creation for both discrimination and identification tasks in perception experiments. 

Please note: TANDEM-STRAIGHT is not open source and cannot be freely distributed here. This tutorial assumes that you have obtained TANDEM-STRAIGHT by your own means. 

In this repository are the endpoint audio files* used in the tutorial and the PDF that provides a tutorial for using the TANDEM-STRAIGHT program.
